Focus on identifying violations or missed opportunities to apply the SOLID and GRASP design principles in the codebase.
Highlight tightly coupled components, unclear responsibilities, or unnecessary dependencies.
Suggest improvements that lead to more modular, maintainable, and extendable code.
Prefer composition over inheritance, and point out places where abstractions can reduce duplication or increase flexibility.
Pay special attention to:
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Classes/functions doing too much
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Logic that's hard to extend without modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Invalid assumptions in inheritance
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Large interfaces or unclear contracts
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Concrete dependencies instead of abstractions
- GRASP patterns like Controller, Creator, Low Coupling, High Cohesion, and Information Expert
When reviewing, use concise and constructive language focused on design quality, not just syntax or formatting.
